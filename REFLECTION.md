# REFLECTION

Some parts of the assessment went really smooth and others I was stuck on for a long time. I actually kind of finished the project on tuesday afternoon but there where 3 things that I was stuck on and I spend Wednesday Googling and trying to find the solution.

The things that went well where the form of 'Schedule viewing', the homepage and displaying the information from the API.

I found it hard to figure a way out to connect the language on the buttons to the right pages. I do know how to code it but the logic behind it took a long time. Also the filtering didn't worked the way they did work in the practise asssesment so that was also annoying. And on the server part, the /agents/:language only worked half (so didn't work actually).

I don't know what I could change next time. My strategy was to first do the things that I knew so that I had the time to figure the rest out on the next day. I believe that was a good strategy.

I think I managed to get enough points but unfortunatelly not everything worked as I hoped and I copied to many lines of code, I think there is a better way to do this.
